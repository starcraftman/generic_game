# generic_game

This is just a place to experiment with design of a small C++ rpg dice type framework.
I don't have a big plan at the moment but will see where it goes.

# How To Build

- Be on linux.
- Run `install.sh`, should probably merge into cmake at some point.
- Build like normal cmake project.
