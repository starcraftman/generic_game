# generic_game

This is just a place to experiment with design of a small C++ rpg dice type framework.
I don't have a big plan at the moment but will see where it goes.

# How To Build

- Be on linux.
- Run `install.sh`, should probably merge into cmake at some point.
- Build like normal cmake project.

# Sketch Outline

- Some sort of dice RPG, may be based on existing ideas though will avoid copyrights.
- Parts definitely needed:
    - Complex roll parsing/result system.
    - Character creation with usual ideas like levels, abilities and progression.
    - Some sort of branching text system for dialogues.
    - Turn based combat system.
    - Not considering a graphics engine at this point, perhaps purely cli or simple graphics system.
